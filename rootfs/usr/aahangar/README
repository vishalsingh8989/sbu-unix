The kernel of an operating system is something you will never see. It basically enables any other programs to execute. It handles events generated by hardware (called interrupts) and software (called system calls), and manages access to resources.
The hardware event handlers (interrupt handlers) will for instance get the number of the key you just pressed, and convert it to the corresponding character stored in a buffer so some program can retrieve it.
ommands available:
date, clear, ps ,kill, ls ,cd ,echo, cat, pwd, pwd
