Welcome to Operating System development; the great frontier.
Not all "make it" in this field, many don't even pass the "Hello World" of OS development, but perhaps you will go further and create the next Linux? Or Windows? Or are your goals lower - MenuetOS? Or even CP/M?
Whatever your goals, OSDev'ing is the great pinnacle of programming. But, you're not alone. In fact, this entire website, including the forums and this Wiki, are dedicated to OSDev'ing. This is not only about great programming skills, but is about community and developing friendships. Be those friendships between fellow forum members or IRQs and processes.
What do you need to succeed in OSDev'ing? You should read the Getting Started article. If you are going to use C/C++ as your language of choice, you are required to build a GCC Cross-Compiler first. And if you prefer to use other Languages then it is important to have some similar tools (e.g. compiler) or if there's no such tools it is often only your efforts that can help you. But going along with your preferred language can add some motivation and excitement during your work.
Good luck!
